The course is validated through 2 assignments. The assignments are carried out by groups of 3 to 5 students.

## First assignment

**Deadline**: October 10th.

The goal of this assignment is to gather, clean and present a dataset. Students can choose any of the above or propose a new project. Note that these projects are not carved in stone but are rather meant as a starting point. Students are encouraged to propose new or derivative projects (but let me know before).

* **Criptocurrency price analysis**. Obtain historical data through [coinmarketcap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) or [blockchain.info API](https://blockchain.info/api) or web scraping and analyze the resulting dataset. Potential tasks:
  - Identify daily, weekly and yearly trends.
  - Prove or deny a correlation between the price of bitcoin and the stock market price.
  - [Correlate with news sentiments](http://blog.nycdatascience.com/student-works/exploring-news-sentiment-price-history-bitcoin/)




* **Network analysis in social media**. Generate a network graph of twitter followers. Suggestion: use the [twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) and [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/).


* **Criptocurrency market visualization and clustering**. Visualize the influence of different criptocurrencies. You can use this scikit-learn example on [visualizing the market structure](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_stock_market.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-stock-market-py) as a starting point.


* **Stock market and twitter analysis**. Study which terms are associated with which company. Dataset: [NASDAQ100](http://followthehashtag.com/dataset/category/stocks-twitter-datasets/)

* **Analysis of geolocalied tweets**. Use a geo-localized social network dataset such as [this one](http://followthehashtag.com/datasets/free-twitter-dataset-usa-200000-free-usa-tweets/) to visualize the activity over a map. See also the [facebook friendship map](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/163413_479288597199_8388607_n.jpg?oh=7ab1d82ba8cba6f185d0c2abde531fb5&oe=5A19E418).

* **Trust and anonymity in bitcoin**. Identify trends in the [Bitcoin OTC social network dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinotc.html). See the related publications for tasks that can be explored in this dataset: [Signed Networks in Social Media](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/triads-chi10.pdf)

* **Adverse food Events**: The [CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/adverse-food-events) is a database that contains information on adverse event and product complaint reports submitted to FDA for foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. Questions: what are the most commonly reported foodstuffs?, what are the most commonly reported medical reactions to foods?, where do people in the US most commonly report food-related conditions?

* **World Atlas of Language Structures**. There are over 7,000 human languages in the world. The [World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/world-atlas-of-language-structures) contains information on the structure of 2,679 of them. Goal: make an interactive map that shows different linguistic features.


* **SF beach water quality**. Analyze and identify patterns in the concentration of bacteria in 15 stations around San Francisco. Dataset: [SF Beaches Water Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/sf-beaches-water)


* **San Francisco yearly budget**. The city of San Francisco has published an [open dataset with the annual budget](https://datasf.org/blog/unpacking-a-10-billion-budget/). Using this dataset, describe how the budget is spent, and formulate recommendations for upcoming years.



## Second assignment

**Deadline**: November 28th.

Goal: Build, deploy and compare machine learning models at scale.

* **Bitcoin price forecasting**

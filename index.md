Technological advances in data gathering and storage have led
to a rapid proliferation of large amounts of data in diverse areas such as climate studies, cosmology, medicine, Web data processing, and engineering. Making sense of this data deluge requires a set of skills which have become fundamental in any major corporation and any almost any scientific discipline.



## Learning objectives

From web scraping and data wrangling to advanced topics like machine learning and deep learning, in this course you will learn a variety of skills by working on real examples.

* **Gather and organize**. Learn how to use Python to gather and organize data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis.
Key technologies: [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
* **Analyze**. Discover patterns and trends lurking in the data and extract conclusions. Key technologies: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](https://scipy.org), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org).
* **Model**. Model complex phenomena and use data to predict the future. Key technologies: scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow.
* **Report**. Display information visually and communicate your findings in a way that is clear and compelling. Software packages: [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [JuPyter](http://jupyter.org/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org).

**Office Hours**: Office hours are available for students who need further clarification of concepts presented in lecture, or have made solid attempts on the homework assignment or other practice problems and require further assistance understanding how to approach such problems.

Tuesday: 16h to 18h.
Friday: 16h to 18h

## Course requirements

This course only requires an undergraduate level on statistics, linear algebra and calculus.

On a more practical level, you will need access to a computer in order to complete the assignments. Bringing your own laptop is highly recommended for the lab sessions.


## Course Schedule

The course is organized in sessions of 3 hours, from 13h to 16h. Each session is split in 1.5h of theory (presentation and whiteboard) and 1.5h of practice.


### Session 1 (September 12th): Foundations of data science I
Introduction to data science and inferential thinking.

**Practical session**: Introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook.

### Session 2 (September 19th): Foundations of data science II
Introduction to data science and inferential thinking, part 2.

**Practical session**: Array computing with NumPy

### Session 3 (September 26th): Visualization

Visualization in Python with Matplotlib.

This session will be mostly practical and will be given by Matplotlib core contributor Nelle Varoquaux.


### Session 4 (October 3rd): Data-driven statistics I
Randomness, empirical distribution and (permutation tests).

**Practical session**: Data cleaning and munging with Pandas.


### Session 5 (October 10th): First student presentation

### Session 6: Data-driven statistics II

**Practical session**: exploring [San Francisco open data](https://datasf.org).


### Session 7: Machine learning I

## Rules	for	Success	(Student	Responsibilities)
This	course	has	four	important	rules.	If	you	choose	to	follow	these	rules,	your	odds	of	learning	the
material	and	earning	a	good	grade	in	this	class	will	improve	greatly	(these	rules	will	also	help	you
succeed	in	your	other	classes).			
1.	**Show	up**. To	succeed	in	this	course,	you	must	choose	to	attend	every	scheduled	class	period	in	its
entirety.	Every	student	has	one	"free”	unexcused	absence	(although	it	is	really	not	free,	you	always	miss
something	when	you	miss	class).		A	second	unexcused	absence	will	result	in	a	5%	cut	in	your	final	class
grade	and	a	third	absence	a	10%	cut.		More	than	three	unexcused	absences	may	result	in
a	failing	grade	for	the	class. Tardiness	of	over	10	minutes	will	result	in	an	absence	for
the	day.
2.	**Do	the	work**. To	succeed	in	this	class,	you	must	choose	to	do	your	very	best	work	in	preparing	for
each	class	session	and	on	all	your	assignments.		See	the [course	Assignments](/assignments.html),	for	additional	information on	completing	assignments.		
3.	**Participate	actively**. To	succeed	in	this	class,	you	must	choose	to	stay	focused	and	involved	in	every
class,	offering	your	best	comments,	questions,	and	answers.		This	is	a	seminar	class,	not	a	lecture	class
–	active	discussion	is	expected	of	all	students.
4. **Respect**		You	will	be	exposed	to	a	variety	of	viewpoints,	values	and	opinions	in	college	that	will	differ
from	your	own.	All	students	in	this	class	should	feel	comfortable	expressing	their	viewpoints	and
concerns	in	class.	You	are	an	important	part	of	creating	an	atmosphere	that	makes	this	possible.		This
applies	to	me too!


## Instructor Responsibilities

What you can expect from me:

* Attend	every	class	period	and	arrive	to	class	on	time.
* Come	to	class	with	a positive and friendly attitude.
* Be	respectful	of	your	ideas	and	value	the	diversity	you	bring	to	the	classroom.
* Be	open	to	dialogue	that	challenges	me.
* Answer	any	appropriate	questions	you	may	have.
* Use	a	variety	of	teaching	techniques	and	modalities to	accommodate	different	learning	styles.
* Return	written	assignments	in	class	and	online	in	a	timely	fashion	and	provide	helpful	feedback.
* Be	present	during	my	stated	office	hours.

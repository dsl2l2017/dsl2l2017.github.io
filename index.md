Technological advances in data gathering and storage have led
to a rapid proliferation of large amounts of data in diverse areas such as climate studies, cosmology, medicine, Web data processing, and engineering. Making sense of this data deluge requires a set of skills which have become fundamental in any major corporation and any almost any scientific discipline.

## Learning objectives

From web scraping and data wrangling to advanced topics like machine learning and deep learning, in this course you will learn a variety of skills by working on real examples.

* **Gather and organize**. Learn how to use Python to gather and organize data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis.
Key technologies: [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
* **Analyze**. Discover patterns and trends lurking in the data and extract conclusions. Key technologies: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](https://scipy.org), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org).
* **Model**. From linear regression to deep learning, learn to model complex phenomena and use data to automate decisions. Key technologies: [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* **Report**. Display information visually and communicate your findings in a way that is clear and compelling. Software packages: [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org).

**Office Hours**: Office hours are available for students who need further clarification of concepts presented in lecture, or have made solid attempts on the homework assignment or other practice problems and require further assistance understanding how to approach such problems.

Tuesday: 16h to 18h.
Friday: 16h to 18h

## Course requirements

This course only requires an undergraduate level on statistics, linear algebra and calculus.

Students are required to come with a laptop to the the lab sessions. Please come with a Python distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) installed to minimize set up time. If you would like to attend but you don't have access to computing resources, contact me and we will figure something up.


## Course Schedule

The course is organized in sessions of 3 hours, from 13h to 16h. Each session is split in 1h of theory (presentation and whiteboard) and 1h45 of lab practice, with a 15min break in-between. The course will take place in [Saturdjia Dai Hall](http://www.berkeley.edu/map?sutardja) room 250.


### Session 1 (September 12th): Foundations of data science I
Introduction to data science and inferential thinking.

**Practical session**: Introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook.

## Rules	for	Success	(Student	Responsibilities)
This	course	has	four	important	rules.	If	you	choose	to	follow	these	rules,	your	odds	of	learning	the
material	and	earning	a	good	grade	in	this	class	will	improve	greatly	(these	rules	will	also	help	you
succeed	in	your	other	classes).			
1.	**Show up**. To	succeed	in	this	course,	you	must	choose	to	attend	every	scheduled	class	period	in	its
entirety.	Every	student	has	one	"free”	unexcused	absence. A	second	unexcused	absence	will	result	in	a	5%	cut	in	your	final	class
grade	and	a	third	absence	a	10%	cut. More	than three unexcused	absences	may	result	in
a	failing	grade	for	the	class. Tardiness	of	over	10	minutes	will	result	in	an	absence	for the day.
2.	**Do	the	work**. To	succeed	in	this	class,	you	must	choose	to	do	your	very	best	work	in	preparing	for
each	class	session	and	on	all	your	assignments.		See	the [course	Assignments](/assignments.html),	for	additional	information on	completing	assignments.		
3.	**Participate	actively**. To	succeed	in	this	class,	you	must	choose	to	stay	focused	and	involved	in	every
class,	offering	your	best	comments,	questions,	and	answers.		This	is	a	seminar	class,	not	a	lecture	class
–	active	discussion	is	expected	of	all	students.
4. **Respect**.		You	will	be	exposed	to	a	variety	of	viewpoints,	values	and	opinions	in	college	that	will	differ
from	your	own.	All	students	in	this	class	should	feel	comfortable	expressing	their	viewpoints	and
concerns	in	class.	You	are	an	important	part	of	creating	an	atmosphere	that	makes	this	possible.		This
applies	to	me too!


## Instructor Responsibilities

What you can expect from me:

* Attend	every	class	period	and	arrive	to	class	on	time.
* Provide access to quality learning material adapted to the level and background of all students.
* Use	a	variety	of	teaching	techniques	and	modalities to	accommodate	different	learning	styles.
* Return	written	assignments	in	class	and	online	in	a	timely	fashion	and	provide	helpful	feedback.
* Come to class with a positive and friendly attitude.
* Be	respectful	of	your	ideas	and	value	the	diversity	you	bring	to	the	classroom.
* Be open to dialogue that challenges me.
* Answer	any	appropriate	questions	you	may	have.
* Be	present	during	my	stated	office	hours.
